# Actions

## Plan

[plan]: https://reliably.com/docs/concepts/plans/

The main action in this repository is the `plan` action. It features:

* Runs [Reliably plan](plan) from within a GitHub workflow
* Allows you to keep your sensitive data in a GitHub Environment so that
  you keep them close to your operations
* Reports its results back to Reliably
* Stores the result files (the log and journal) as a commit in the repository
* Stores a file listing all the licences of all the packages used as part
  of run within the commit

The basic action usage is as follows:

```yaml
name: Execute a Reliably Plan

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  execute-reliably-plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: reliablyhq/actions/plan@main
```

Store this as a workflow called `reliably-plan.yaml`.
